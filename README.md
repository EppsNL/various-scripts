# Various Scripts, OMG!
You guest it, a bunch of useful scripts I wrote or picked up through the years.

## The Scripts
### Autohotkey/Keychron.*
Autohotkey script and icon to fix minor annoyances with my Keychron C1 mechanical keyboard.
- Ctrl + Caps Lock: Change selected text to `lowercase`, `UPPERCASE`, `Sentence case` or `Title Case`. NOTE: Requires script to run as administrator to function!
- Remap `Right Windows` to `Context Menu`.
- Remap `Cortana/Mic` to `ms-settings:sound`
- Keychron.*: Autohotkey script which remaps the right windows key to the context menukey

### batchscripts/switchto*.bat
2 batch files which I call from my Stream Deck to toggle between ethernet and wifi. See note in batch files on how to set up.

### batchscripts/zipall.bat
Batch file to zip all subfolders into their own zip file. Extremely usefull for quickly making CBZ files and archival.

### slavepen motd/*
The .bashrc I use don my 2015-2022 home server setup. The image is converted to ASCI art and used as a large banner. Dependencies `catimg`, `sensors`, `wget` and probably some more I forgot.

Q: What's with the name?! <br />
A: I like to theme my network devices. At the time I went with a BDSM theme: The Dungeon (SSID), Slave-Pen (media server), Dominatrix (desktop), Vibrating-Egg (phone), Toybag (tablet) etc.
